 What I need here is a simple but well-organized HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript project with one view and organized style and script sheets that are imported. On the primary view, which can be called index, I need a component-based structure wherein on the left-hand side is a thin vertical column contains a vertical navigation component (list items that are centered to the viewport height). The center of the view has two stacked blocks. One is a thin component (short component, not that tall) and it's also a navigation on the top with the list items shown horizontally as icons. There should be four of them in background color. And then the primary content is like an article (so there is an article header and then there is a body paragraph). I need this content to be centered within its container. The article header and body are centered within the container, which is part of the stack with the nav on top of it. So left-hand nav, top nav, and center content with appropriate styling. I want to use the font family Inter, I want the kerning to be -2 (sorry, -0.2) for the text, I want the title font to be bold and have a higher font size than the body, and I want the body text to be normal and simple like that. The text should all be black. The background should be white of the whole thing. Let's start with this.
